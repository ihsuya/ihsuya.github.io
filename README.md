### Electrical Engineering : Cognitive Sciences : Particle Physics : Artificial Intelligence : Astrophysics

I am a 2nd year student majoring in the department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Apart from my branch, I have a keen interest in the field of cognitive sciences, particle physics, astrophysics and artificial intelligence- (but I haven't done any projects in these fields ;-;). This is an experimental site where I am just experimenting with the features of GitHub (as I a extremely new here and quite intimidated to experiment and create pages with my main github account), so if you manage to find this link; don't take it too seriously :"))

My GitHub account is [ihsuya](https://ihsuya.github.io/). Will link to my main account too once it's completed and thoroughly customised.

By the way, I am making these changes in 2020. Just realised I can strikethrough my texts by wrapping the piece of text under consideration using 2 tildes(~) around it. 

*Life is but a game of brains.*

#### Gonna learn bits about deeper programming everyday and learn new stuff
